### FundamentalsOfWebDevelopment ###
A repo of my work for the University of Cincinnati IT2040C Fundamentals of Web Development

### Highlights ###
Module 13: GPST Rework. My redesign of the Green Pastures Stable and Training website which can be found in Module 11. The images and written content were reused but all HTML and CSS is brand new.
Module 14: Final Project. A fully original website by me: Kroger Cashiering for Humans.

### Note ###

The course did not allow for any usage of any web tools/languages other than CSS and HTML. The main goal was to create responsive and accessible websites, which I think I achieved fairly well.
