						<h3>How do I tell if a U.S. dollar is legitimate?</h3>
						The best thing to do for this is to ask a manager since they have a cheat sheet and a special light that makes it easy to identify fakes. You personally can check for transparency effects and texture of the bills (look for Franklin's face on the right of a $100 bill when holding it up to the light). However, a lot of the time, if someone is providing false currency, there are tip-offs that you can look out for.
						<br><br>- They are giving you a huge bill for a very small order. Sometimes they just only get their paychecks in large bills, and most are largely innocent, but this is a common way for scammers to get a lot of real money easily.
						<br>- They are asking you to split a large bill after the order is over. If the bill is less than $20, you are allowed to do this, but <b>if the bill is larger than $20 ABSOLUTELY DO NOT SPLIT IT</b>. Because it is off the record, it is hard to track if you do get scammed, and I've seen it happen personally several times.
						<br>- They are buying a ton of gift cards and paying for all of it in cash. This is another circumstance where a scammer would greatly benefit, so make sure you check that the bills are legitimate.
						<br>- Check for other signs of fraudulent behavior, including if the person is acting unusually nervous, is trying to tell you to do something you know isn't right, etc. At Kroger, we have great trust in and commitment to our customers, but we cannot let that devotion turn into naivety.

					<div class="FaqItem">
						<h3>What does the CD Pickup message mean?</h3>
						If the register is prompting you about a CD pickup, that means you have an unsafe amount of cash in your drawer, and some needs to be transfered to another location. If you get this error, contact a member of management, and they will take the excess from your drawer. They will complete the CD pickup on their end, so you don't have to do anything. If you wait too long to do it, the register will not let you do anything until the pickup is complete.
					</div>
					<div class="FaqItem">
						<h3>Where do I put big bills ($50-100)?</h3>
						The correct place to put them is under the tray that holds everything else. Sometimes people put them on top of the Checks and Stamps, but this position is less secure and just adds more clutter.

					<div class="FaqItem">
						<h3>The check isn't reading, what do I do?</h3>
						- Are you inserting it in the right orientation? The signature should be on the right.
						<br>- Is the check wrinkled or folded? Try smoothing it out and then try it again.
						<br>- If neither of these are the case, you might want to try another check of theirs if they have one. If even that doesn't work, they'll need to find another method of payment, since we can't enter checks manually.
					</div>
					<div class="FaqItem">
						<h3>Why is it asking for a Driver's License when processing a check?</h3>
						People that have fallen victim to identity theft prior or who haven't used a checking account may need to provide an ID at checkout. Make sure that the name on the ID matches that of the check (you cannot honor the check if they don't, even if it's the person's alleged spouse).

					<div class="FaqItem">
						<h3>Can we accept expired coupons?</h3>
						No. I might do it if it just expired today and the value isn't high, but that would be a special case.
					</div>
					<div class="FaqItem">
						<h3>Coupons are giving errors that I have to override all the time even when they shouldn't, what's the deal?</h3>
						A lot of the time the error message it gives you is the key to understanding why the coupon doesn't work. A lot of the time coupons can apply to a number of items from a brand, in which case it may give a "manufacturer valid" error. Sometimes the coupon is just straight up coded wrong and won't even register when the correct item is bought. If so, just override it or use the Manufacturer Coupon option from the Modify Trans page.

				<h1><a href="#DigitalCoupons">Digital Coupons</a></h1>
				<div class="FaqSectionContent" id="DigitalCoupons">
					<div class="FaqItem">
						<h3>Are we allowed to give people digital coupon prices who haven't clipped them?</h3>
						On the one hand, no, by policy we are not supposed to give them the digital price. On the other hand, Kroger's "Make it Right" policy insists that we are supposed to. In general, do what your management does. If the cashier next to you is giving people digital prices, but you aren't, the customers that notice will typically be very mad. Staying consistent with your management's policies in this is key, so that the customers can have a consistent experience, and you can have backup if you need it.
						<br><br>However, no matter your stance, there are some coupons you definitely shoul not be handing out. Flat discounts like "$10 off $75" should not be put in manually. Many digital coupons have a limited number of uses (often 5), so if a customer wants you to override the price of his coke products, make sure you only override within the coupon's limit.
					</div>
					<div class="FaqItem">
						<h3>What's the best way to manually enter a digital coupon?</h3>
						As of November 2023, the best way is to do a price override and select the digital coupon option, this makes it clear which item has received the sale. Otherwise typing "23456" will allow you to enter an amount for a generic discount labeled "Digital Coupon." I would not reccomend this option since it is rather vague.
					</div>
					<div class="FaqItem">
						<h3>The customer is wanting a digital coupon you can't find, what do you do?</h3>
						First, check the Kroger app. Next, if their is a shelf label, check it. If it is neither of those places, have the customer pull up their kroger app. If it exists, it should be in their clipped coupons. Sometimes Kroger offers exclusive personal discounts to customers, so that might be why your not finding it. If it is not in any of these places, there really isn't anything you can do.

				<div class="FaqSectionContent" id="Instacart">
					<div class="FaqItem">
						<h3>Do I need to know how Instacart works, as a cashier?</h3>
						Instacart is in no way affiliated with the Kroger Co. It is the Instacart shopper's PAID JOB to finish their order themselves and do their end on their own. You can help them find a confusing item or connect to the store's wifi, but you should not be doing their job for them.
					</div>
					<div class="FaqItem">
						<h3>Can I scan an Instacart barcode after scanning an item/s?</h3>
						No. You will need to void the transaction, and restart it from the top (remembering to scan the barcode this time of course).

						<h3>How do I tell if a card has NFC (tap) capabilities?</h3>
						1.Just try it.
						<br>2.Look for a wifi symbol.
					</div>
					<div class="FaqItem">
						<h3>What happens if my check printer doesn't actually fill out the check?</h3>
						You will just have to have the customer fill the rest of it out. By policy, we are not supposed to fill out customer checks ourselves. If the check printer is not working, check the ink ribbon.
					</div>
					<div class="FaqItem">
						<h3>The customer's EFT card doesn't have a chip or a swipe strip, only a barcode. What do I do?</h3>
						Simply hit EFT, for once press ok, then while in the credit card number entry screen, simply scan the barcode. If Kroger accepts the card, it should go through. This type of card is common amount medical or foodstamp kindof things, and those can have pretty specific and confusing benefits, so often they might not work nonetheless.

						<h3>What is the difference between Cucumbers and Zuccini?</h3>
						Zuccini's have a rooty cap, cucumbers don't. Zuccini is more ridged while cucumbers are more smooth.
					</div>
					<div class="FaqItem">
						<h3>What's the difference between all the Broccolis?</h3>
						The most common form of broccoli is "3082 - broccoli crowns/florets" which are sold by weight and never have a tag/barcode. Regular "4060 - Broccoli" will usually be bigger and have a tag on it. 4060 Broccoli is sold by quantity.
					</div>
					<div class="FaqItem">
						<h3>What is the difference between colored bell peppers?</h3>
						Green bell peppers and cheaper than the other colors, but all the other colors are priced the same. Similarly, organic green bell peppers are cheaper than the others, though organic peppers are overall more expensive than regular ones.
					</div>
					<div class="FaqItem">
						<h3>Why do the two produce search options have inconsistent results?</h3>
						This is a good question that I wish I could answer, but I cannot. The category search generally has a larger database of produce than the text search, so there are some inconsistencies there. Some items (tomatillos for example) are simply in neither, and you'll need to consult a <a href="Resources.html#ProduceCodes">produce sheet</a>. Some items like yellow bell peppers and the text search's habenero peppers are blatantly miscoded. It has been like this for at least a year as of November 2023, so hopefully they fix it sooner rather than later.

				<h1><a href="#Scanning">Scanning</a></h1>
				<div class="FaqSectionContent" id="Scanning">
					<div class="FaqItem">
						<h3>How do I get and maintain a high IPM?</h3>
						First and foremost is getting the experience and muscle memory, but there is another crucial thing to know about. Whenever there is any downtime between scanning, <b>LOCK YOUR DRAWER</b>. It's quick to lock and unlock with a short password, even quicker than totalling. It promotes security. Most importantly, it will eliminate any downtime that is ruining your IPM. I cannot stress how much this helps.
					</div>
					<div class="FaqItem">
						<h3>I can't get produce barcodes to scan, how do I do it quickly?</h3>
						There are a couple of useful techniques. First, if they are in plastic bags, either remove one or make sure the tag is right on the surface of the bag, to eliminate wrinkles in the bag that prevent scanning. Slowly ease the hand scanner closer and farther away from the tag, or press the tag right against the main scanner plate.
					</div>
					<div class="FaqItem">
						<h3>The item doesn't have a barcode or the barcode is damaged, how can I ring it up?</h3>
						There are a few methods depending on the barcode and item.
						<br><br>- If the barcode is damaged, but all the numbers are visible, simply type those in. <b>For regular products</b>, type in all the numbers <b>except the last one</b>, which typically sits a little outside the barcode. <b>For bakery and some other in-house products</b>, type in all the numbers <b>excluding all the leading zeroes</b>.
						<br>- If the numbers aren't legible, you either need to get a duplicate item with a useable barcode or take a picture of a shelf tag and scan that. Alternatively, you can look up the item on the Kroger app, and at the bottom of the product page, you can find the product's UPC numbers, which can be entered as per the previous instruction.
						<br>- If the barcode gives you an <b>"Item not found" error</b>, you will probably need to enter the price manually using a department code. Consult your manager before doing this, since they don't want us to do this very often. Note: <b>Do not manually enter age restricted products </b>(alcohol, cigarettes, etc.).
